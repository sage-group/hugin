Hugin EO: Machine Learning for Earth Observation made easy
==========================================================

Hugin helps scientists run Machine Learning experiments on geospatial raster data.

Overall Hugin aims to facilitate experimentation with multiple machine learning problems, like:

 - Classification
 - Segmentation
 - Super-Resolution

Hugin was developed as part of the ESA funded ML4EO_, supporting the needs of the project.

Currently Hugin builds on top of the Keras machine learning library but it also aims to support, in the future, additional backends like scikit-learn.
