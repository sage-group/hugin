# HuginEO

**IMPORTANT**: _Currently the HuginEO is undergoing massive refactoring. Until release `0.3.0` expect broken interfaces and inconsistent documentation.

Hugin helps scientists run Machine Learning experiments on geospatial raster data.

Overall Hugin aims to facilitate experimentation with multiple machine learning problems, like:

 - Classification
 - Segmentation
 - Super-Resolution

Currently, Hugin builds on top of the Keras machine learning library, but it also aims to support, in the future, additional backends like scikit-learn and pytorch.

Documentation for Hugin is available at https://hugin-eo.readthedocs.io/
